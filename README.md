## Introduction

The OOP project combines the principles of object-oriented programming with blockchain technology to create a decentralized exchange, wallet, blockchain explorer, supermarket, and token system. The project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these components interact with each other and demonstrate their practical implementation.

## Features

The project includes the following components and features:

1. **Exchange**: The exchange component allows users to trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner. It supports buying and selling of tokens, order matching, and maintaining an order book.

2. **Wallet**: The wallet component provides users with a secure digital wallet to store and manage their tokens. It supports token transfers, balance management, and transaction history tracking.

3. **Blockchain Explorer**: The blockchain explorer component allows users to explore the blockchain network. It provides functionality to view blocks, transactions, and token balances of specific addresses.

4. **Supermarket**: The supermarket component is a virtual marketplace where users can purchase real-world products using the project's token. It demonstrates the integration of blockchain-based payments in a practical scenario.

5. **Token**: The token component represents a digital asset that can be traded and used within the project ecosystem. It showcases the creation, distribution, and utilization of a custom token on the blockchain.
